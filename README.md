I ran into an issue with the code so was not able to complete all deliverables.

## Deliverable 1 Requirements
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 1 by completing all requirements below:
- The Amazon_Reviews_ETL.ipynb file does the following:
- An Amazon Review dataset is extracted as a DataFrame (10 pt)
- The extracted dataset is transformed into four DataFrames with the correct columns (20 pt)
- All four DataFrames are loaded into their respective tables in pgAdmin (10 pt)

## Deliverable 2 Requirements
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 2 by completing all requirements below:

- The analysis does the following:
- There is a DataFrame or table for the vine_table data using one of three methods above (5 pt)
- The data is filtered to create a DataFrame or table where there are 20 or more total votes (5 pt)
- The data is filtered to create a DataFrame or table where the percentage of helpful_votes is equal to or greater than 50% (5 pt)
- The data is filtered to create a DataFrame or table where there is a Vine review (5 pt)
- The data is filtered to create a DataFrame or table where there isn’t a Vine review (5 pt)
- The total number of reviews, the number of 5-star reviews, and the percentage 5-star reviews are calculated for all Vine and non-Vine reviews (15 pt)

## Deliverable 3: A Written Report on the Analysis (20 points)
Deliverable 3 Instructions
For this part of the Challenge, you’ll write a report that summarizes the analysis you performed in Deliverable 2.

The report should contain the following:

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:
- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
I was not able to run the code so was not able to complete analysis. 
- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
I was not able to run the code so was not able to complete analysis. 
- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
I was not able to run the code so was not able to complete analysis. 

## Summary: 
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
